Adds an additional module to Beaver Builder that allows for multimarker maps with optional filtering based on custom post type and category as well as an option to apply shortcodes before and after a row is rendered.

== Description ==
 This plugin adds additional modules and enhancements to Beaver Builder that allows you to create multimarker Google Maps and to add shortcodes before and after a row to enable easy content restriction by membership status using any add on that supplies the relevant shortcodes. You can create multimarker maps by giving it any post type that has a location field that returns an array of (lat,lng) or just a string of 'lat,lng'. It also provides an option to use custom icons for the posts based on their category and to filter the map based on those categories and includes an optional radius around the marker that can be set on a default and a post by post basis.
